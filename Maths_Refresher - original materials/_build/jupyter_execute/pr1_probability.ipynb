    "\n",
    "One way to define probability is through the notion of *relative frequency*. If we carry out an experiment (e.g. rolling of a die) a large number of times, then the proportion of times a particular result (e.g. a six) occurs is known as the relative frequency.  If we repeat the experiment a very large number of times then the limiting value of the relative frequency (i.e. the value that the relative frequency approaches as the number of times approaches infinity) is called a *probability*.\n",

    "\n",
    "The plot below shows the relative frequency of 6s when a die is rolled repeatedly. The first roll was not a 6, and so the relative frequency is zero. The second roll was a 6, so the relative frequency is 0.5. As we then roll the die further, the relative frequency fluctuates. But from the figure we see that as the number of rolls increases, the relative frequency converges to 1/6."
