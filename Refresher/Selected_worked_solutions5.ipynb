    "It's useful to draw a probability tree (see the figure below below). Basically, you want to start in the left-hand box (alive at age 50) and end up in the \"alive at age 80\" box. This involves following three arrows. Because each of these paths need to happen (i.e. these are intersections not unions), you multiply the probabilities of following the three arrows you need to follow. \n",

    "In the probability tree, there are two ways of dying between 70 and 90, for someone who is alive at age 50.  Either they survive the first and second decade, and then die (between 70 and 80), or they survive the first, second and third decade and then die (between 80 and 90). Because this is a union of disjoint events (one or the other can happen but not both), we add the two probabilities.
